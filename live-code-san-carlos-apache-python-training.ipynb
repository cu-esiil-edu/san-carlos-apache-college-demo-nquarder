        "\n",
        "Vector data are composed of discrete geometric locations (x, y values) known as vertices that define the “shape” of the spatial object. The organization of the vertices determines the type of vector that you are working with. There are three types of vector data:\n",
        "\n",
        "**Points:** Each individual point is defined by a single x, y coordinate. Examples of point data include: sampling locations, the location of individual trees or the location of plots.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Lines:** Lines are composed of many (at least 2) vertices, or points, that are connected. For instance, a road or a stream may be represented by a line. This line is composed of a series of segments, each “bend” in the road or stream represents a vertex that has defined x, y location.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Polygons:** A polygon consists of 3 or more vertices that are connected and “closed”. Thus, the outlines of plot boundaries, lakes, oceans, and states or countries are often represented by polygons.\n",
