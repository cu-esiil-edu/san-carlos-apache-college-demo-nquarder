# san-carlos-apache-college

This is a repository for work done in collaboration with ESIIL and San Carlos Apache College. The Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) demonstrates how to open and plot spatial and time-series data using Python. Specifically, a shapefile of the American Indian Alaska Native Native Hawaiian (AIANNH) areas is opened and maps of the Navajo Nation (Din√©) and San Carlos Apache Reservation are generated. Time-series data from a weather station on the Black River are also explored as an application. Finally, a map of the San Carlos Apache Reservation and San Carlos Apache College is created using folium.
